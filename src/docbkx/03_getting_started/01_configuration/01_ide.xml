	<title>Setting up a configuration environment</title>

	<para>
		Since Eclipse NeoSCADA is based on Java and Eclipse, both have to be
		installed to get it to run. In this chapter we will show how to install
		Java, Eclipse and all necessary plugins to get started. 
	</para>
	
	<section xml:id="setup_ide_java">
		<title>Installing Java</title>
		
        <note><title>Java 8</title>
		<para>
			At the time of writing Java 8 was just released, so the current version
			which is still in use in conjunction with Eclipse NeoSCADA is Java 7.
			Java 8 should theoretically work, but it is not tested so far.
		</para>
        </note>
		
		<section>
			<title>On Windows</title>
			
			<para>
				The recommended way on Windows is to use the official Java
				installation package provided by Oracle. The download site
				is to be found at: <link xlink:href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html</link>.
				We recommend that you install Java for the same architecture
				as your system is. That means if you have a 64bit Windows, then also
				install the 64bit version of Java. If you have a 32bit Windows, you 
				have to install the 32bit version of Java as well. It is possible 
				to install the 32bit Version Java on a 64bit Windows, but unless 
				you have important reasons to do that, we will not recommend it.
			</para>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<title>On Linux</title>
			
			<para>
				The default Java package for most Linux distributions is the OpenJDK.
				To install the OpenJDK for your flavor of Linux use the package
				management tool of your distribution and install the package
				<filename>openjdk-7-jdk</filename> (the name of the package might be 
				slightly different depending on your distribution, on Red Hat for 
				instance it is called <filename>java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel</filename>).
				The important thing is, to install the JDK and not the JRE.
				If you install Java via the package manager, you will automatically
				get the correct version for your architecture (32bit or 64bit).
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Alternatively you can install the official Java Version from Oracle.
				To switch between the installed versions use the command:
				<programlisting language="bash"><![CDATA[sudo alternatives --config java]]></programlisting>
			</para>

		<title>Installing Eclipse</title>
	
		<para>
			The current version (0.3) of Eclipse NeoSCADA is based on the Mars 
			release (4.5). Although the following instructions work  without 
			change with the Neon release,
			we recommend to stay with the Kepler release. For Release 0.4
			it is planned to depend on Java 8 and we will switch
			to the Neon release.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Traditionally Eclipse comes as a simple ZIP file, which just has
			to be extracted to somewhere on the file system and can be run from
			there. Even though many Linux distributions will include Eclipse
			in its package repositories, we do not recommend to use those.
			Just download the Eclipse Kepler release from the archives: <link xlink:href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr2</link> since.
			You have to download the same architecture as the Java Version you 
			installed.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Unzip it to a directory of your choice. From there you can now start it.
		</para>

		<title>Installing the Eclipse NeoSCADA plugins</title>
	
		<para>
			Next step is to install the necessary plugins which contain the actual 
			Eclipse NeoSCADA components. For this go to
            <menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu><guimenuitem>Install New Software</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. 
			In the text box "Work with" just enter following URL: 
			<link xlink:href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipsescada/updates/release/0.3/"/>
			Then select the "Eclipse NeoSCADA IDE" category and click on "Next".
			The next screen should contain all the additionally selected 
			dependencies. Click on "Next" there as well. On the next screen 
			accept the Licenses and click on "Finish". After the installation 
			Eclipse requires a restart. Do that.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Additionally you can now install the additional openSCADA components. 
			These contain the OPC and the SNMP adapters. To install it just repeat the steps
			above with the URL <link xlink:href="http://thedrone.packagedrone.org/p2/openscada-1.4/"/>
			and select the "OpenSCADA IDE" category.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			After a restart of your Eclipse IDE you are ready to start configuring
			the SCADA system. For this please read further in <xref linkend="chap_configuration" />.
